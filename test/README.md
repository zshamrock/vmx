There are 2 env variables which control where the `vmx` looks for the application config and SSH config.

They are: `VMX_HOME` and `VMX_SSH_CONFIG_HOME`.

So the data in this directory is used for testing when the corresponding env variables set to point to `config` and
`ssh` inner directories correspondingly.
